## Retrieve AD accounts with description 

Execute `get_description.py` (or get_description.exe) in a shell. This will request the Domain Controller using the Powershell script `Get_Desc.ps1`.

Once done, you will find json files stored in the `output` directory. This files will be used by the `check_description.py` script.

## Finding password in descriptions

Case 1: You already extracted the hashes from the ntds using [secretdump.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py) or [gosecretdump.exe](https://github.com/C-Sto/gosecretsdump) just put the file with the hashes in the `ntds` folder. **The name of the file MUST be `output.ntds`**
then execute `check_description.py` (or check_description.exe).

</p>

Case 2: You have the `ntds.dit` and `SYSTEM hive` file but the hashes are not extracted yet. Execute `check_description.py -extract -ntds path\to\ntds.dit -system path\to\SYSTEM\hive`

If passwords are discovered in descriptions the results will be put in the `results` directory.
